The following Python snippet demonstrates a simple planning agent decomposing a goal into subtasks and generating a structured plan:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from enum import Enum
from typing import List, Optional, Union
import json
import os
from typing import Optional
from pprint import pprint
from autogen_core.models import UserMessage, SystemMessage, AssistantMessage
from autogen_ext.models.azure import AzureAIChatCompletionClient
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

class AgentEnum(str, Enum):
    FlightBooking = "flight_booking"
    HotelBooking = "hotel_booking"
    CarRental = "car_rental"
    ActivitiesBooking = "activities_booking"
    DestinationInfo = "destination_info"
    DefaultAgent = "default_agent"
    GroupChatManager = "group_chat_manager"

# Travel SubTask Model
class TravelSubTask(BaseModel):
    task_details: str
    assigned_agent: AgentEnum  # we want to assign the task to the agent

class TravelPlan(BaseModel):
    main_task: str
    subtasks: List[TravelSubTask]
    is_greeting: bool

client = AzureAIChatCompletionClient(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    endpoint="https://models.inference.ai.azure.com",
    # To authenticate with the model you will need to generate a personal access token (PAT) in your GitHub settings.
    # Create your PAT token by following instructions here: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens
    credential=AzureKeyCredential(os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]),
    model_info={
        "json_output": False,
        "function_calling": True,
        "vision": True,
        "family": "unknown",
    },
)

# Define the user message
messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="""You are an planner agent.
    Your job is to decide which agents to run based on the user's request.
                      Provide your response in JSON format with the following structure:
{'main_task': 'Plan a family trip from Singapore to Melbourne.',
 'subtasks': [{'assigned_agent': 'flight_booking',
               'task_details': 'Book round-trip flights from Singapore to '
                               'Melbourne.'}
    Below are the available agents specialised in different tasks:
    - FlightBooking: For booking flights and providing flight information
    - HotelBooking: For booking hotels and providing hotel information
    - CarRental: For booking cars and providing car rental information
    - ActivitiesBooking: For booking activities and providing activity information
    - DestinationInfo: For providing information about destinations
    - DefaultAgent: For handling general requests""", source="system"),
    UserMessage(
        content="Create a travel plan for a family of 2 kids from Singapore to Melboune", source="user"),
]

response = await client.create(messages=messages, extra_create_args={"response_format": 'json_object'})

response_content: Optional[str] = response.content if isinstance(
    response.content, str) else None
if response_content is None:
    raise ValueError("Response content is not a valid JSON string" )

pprint(json.loads(response_content))

# # Ensure the response content is a valid JSON string before loading it
# response_content: Optional[str] = response.content if isinstance(
#     response.content, str) else None
# if response_content is None:
#     raise ValueError("Response content is not a valid JSON string")

# # Print the response content after loading it as JSON
# pprint(json.loads(response_content))

# Validate the response content with the MathReasoning model
# TravelPlan.model_validate(json.loads(response_content))
```

### Planning Agent with Multi-Agent Orchestration

In this example, a Semantic Router Agent receives a user request (e.g., "I need a hotel plan for my trip.").

The planner then:

* Receives the Hotel Plan: The planner takes the user’s message and, based on a system prompt (including available agent details), generates a structured travel plan.
* Lists Agents and Their Tools: The agent registry holds a list of agents (e.g., for flight, hotel, car rental, and activities) along with the functions or tools they offer.
* Routes the Plan to the Respective Agents: Depending on the number of subtasks, the planner either sends the message directly to a dedicated agent (for single-task scenarios) or coordinates via a group chat manager for multi-agent collaboration.
* Summarizes the Outcome: Finally, the planner summarizes the generated plan for clarity.
The following Python code sample illustrates these steps:

```python

from pydantic import BaseModel

from enum import Enum
from typing import List, Optional, Union

class AgentEnum(str, Enum):
    FlightBooking = "flight_booking"
    HotelBooking = "hotel_booking"
    CarRental = "car_rental"
    ActivitiesBooking = "activities_booking"
    DestinationInfo = "destination_info"
    DefaultAgent = "default_agent"
    GroupChatManager = "group_chat_manager"

# Travel SubTask Model

class TravelSubTask(BaseModel):
    task_details: str
    assigned_agent: AgentEnum # we want to assign the task to the agent

class TravelPlan(BaseModel):
    main_task: str
    subtasks: List[TravelSubTask]
    is_greeting: bool
import json
import os
from typing import Optional

from autogen_core.models import UserMessage, SystemMessage, AssistantMessage
from autogen_ext.models.openai import AzureOpenAIChatCompletionClient

# Create the client with type-checked environment variables

client = AzureOpenAIChatCompletionClient(
    azure_deployment=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"),
    model=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"),
    api_version=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION"),
    azure_endpoint=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),
    api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),
)

from pprint import pprint

# Define the user message

messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="""You are an planner agent.
    Your job is to decide which agents to run based on the user's request.
    Below are the available agents specialized in different tasks:
    - FlightBooking: For booking flights and providing flight information
    - HotelBooking: For booking hotels and providing hotel information
    - CarRental: For booking cars and providing car rental information
    - ActivitiesBooking: For booking activities and providing activity information
    - DestinationInfo: For providing information about destinations
    - DefaultAgent: For handling general requests""", source="system"),
    UserMessage(content="Create a travel plan for a family of 2 kids from Singapore to Melbourne", source="user"),
]

response = await client.create(messages=messages, extra_create_args={"response_format": TravelPlan})

# Ensure the response content is a valid JSON string before loading it

response_content: Optional[str] = response.content if isinstance(response.content, str) else None
if response_content is None:
    raise ValueError("Response content is not a valid JSON string")

# Print the response content after loading it as JSON

pprint(json.loads(response_content))
```

What follows is the output from the previous code and you can then use this structured output to route to `assigned_agent` and summarize the travel plan to the end user.

```json
{
    "is_greeting": "False",
    "main_task": "Plan a family trip from Singapore to Melbourne.",
    "subtasks": [
        {
            "assigned_agent": "flight_booking",
            "task_details": "Book round-trip flights from Singapore to Melbourne."
        },
        {
            "assigned_agent": "hotel_booking",
            "task_details": "Find family-friendly hotels in Melbourne."
        },
        {
            "assigned_agent": "car_rental",
            "task_details": "Arrange a car rental suitable for a family of four in Melbourne."
        },
        {
            "assigned_agent": "activities_booking",
            "task_details": "List family-friendly activities in Melbourne."
        },
        {
            "assigned_agent": "destination_info",
            "task_details": "Provide information about Melbourne as a travel destination."
        }
    ]
}
```

An example notebook with the previous code sample is available [here](../../../07-planning-design/07-autogen.ipynb).

### Iterative Planning

Some tasks require a back-and-forth or re-planning, where the outcome of one subtask influences the next. For example, if the agent discovers an unexpected data format while booking flights, it might need to adapt its strategy before moving on to hotel bookings.

Additionally, user feedback (e.g. a human deciding they prefer an earlier flight) can trigger a partial re-plan. This dynamic, iterative approach ensures that the final solution aligns with real-world constraints and evolving user preferences.

e.g sample code

```python
from autogen_core.models import UserMessage, SystemMessage, AssistantMessage
#.. same as previous code and pass on the user history, current plan
messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="""You are a planner agent to optimize the
    Your job is to decide which agents to run based on the user's request.
    Below are the available agents specialized in different tasks:
    - FlightBooking: For booking flights and providing flight information
    - HotelBooking: For booking hotels and providing hotel information
    - CarRental: For booking cars and providing car rental information
    - ActivitiesBooking: For booking activities and providing activity information
    - DestinationInfo: For providing information about destinations
    - DefaultAgent: For handling general requests""", source="system"),
    UserMessage(content="Create a travel plan for a family of 2 kids from Singapore to Melbourne", source="user"),
    AssistantMessage(content=f"Previous travel plan - {TravelPlan}", source="assistant")
]
# .. re-plan and send the tasks to respective agents
```

## Summary

In this article, we have looked at an example of how we can create a planner that can dynamically select the available agents defined. The output of the Planner decomposes the tasks and assigns the agents so they can be executed. It is assumed the agents have access to the functions/tools that are required to perform the task. In addition to the agents, you can include other patterns like reflection, summarizer, and round robin chat to further customize.
