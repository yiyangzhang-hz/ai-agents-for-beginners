. According to Wikipedia, an actor is _the basic building block of concurrent computation. In response to a message it receives, an actor can: make local decisions, create more actors, send more messages, and determine how to respond to the next message received_.

**Use Cases**: Automating code generation, data analysis tasks, and building custom agents for planning and research functions.

Here are some important core concepts of AutoGen:

- **Agents**. An agent is a software entity that:
  - **Communicates via messages**, these messages can be synchronous or asynchronous.
  - **Maintains its own state**, which can be modified by incoming messages.
  - **Performs actions** in response to received messages or changes in its state. These actions may modify the agent’s state and produce external effects, such as updating message logs, sending new messages, executing code, or making API calls.
    
  Here you have a short code snippet in which you create your own agent with Chat capabilities:

    ```python
    from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent
    from autogen_agentchat.messages import TextMessage
    from autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient


    class MyAssistant(RoutedAgent):
        def __init__(self, name: str) -> None:
            super().__init__(name)
            model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model="gpt-4o")
            self._delegate = AssistantAgent(name, model_client=model_client)
    
        @message_handler
        async def handle_my_message_type(self, message: MyMessageType, ctx: MessageContext) -> None:
            print(f"{self.id.type} received message: {message.content}")
            response = await self._delegate.on_messages(
                [TextMessage(content=message.content, source="user")], ctx.cancellation_token
            )
            print(f"{self.id.type} responded: {response.chat_message.content}")
    ```
    
    In the previous code, `MyAssistant` has been created and inherits from `RoutedAgent`. It has a message handler that prints the content of the message and then sends a response using the `AssistantAgent` delegate. Especially note how we assign to `self._delegate` an instance of `AssistantAgent` which is a pre-built agent that can handle chat completions.


    Let's let AutoGen know about this agent type and kick off the program next:

    ```python
    
    # main.py
    runtime = SingleThreadedAgentRuntime()
    await MyAgent.register(runtime, "my_agent", lambda: MyAgent())

    runtime.start()  # Start processing messages in the background.
    await runtime.send_message(MyMessageType("Hello, World!"), AgentId("my_agent", "default"))
    ```

    In the previous code the agents are registered with the runtime and then a message is sent to the agent resulting in the following output:

    ```text
    # Output from the console:
    my_agent received message: Hello, World!
    my_assistant received message: Hello, World!
    my_assistant responded: Hello! How can I assist you today?
    ```

- **Multi agents**. AutoGen supports the creation of multiple agents that can work together to achieve complex tasks. Agents can communicate, share information, and coordinate their actions to solve problems more efficiently. To create a multi-agent system, you can define different types of agents with specialized functions and roles, such as data retrieval, analysis, decision-making, and user interaction. Let's see how such a creation looks like so we get a sense of it:

    ```python
    editor_description = "Editor for planning and reviewing the content."

    # Example of declaring an Agent
    editor_agent_type = await EditorAgent.register(
    runtime,
    editor_topic_type,  # Using topic type as the agent type.
    lambda: EditorAgent(
        description=editor_description,
        group_chat_topic_type=group_chat_topic_type,
        model_client=OpenAIChatCompletionClient(
            model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
            # api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
        ),
        ),
    )

    # remaining declarations shortened for brevity

    # Group chat
    group_chat_manager_type = await GroupChatManager.register(
    runtime,
    "group_chat_manager",
    lambda: GroupChatManager(
        participant_topic_types=[writer_topic_type, illustrator_topic_type, editor_topic_type, user_topic_type],
        model_client=OpenAIChatCompletionClient(
            model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
            # api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
        ),
        participant_descriptions=[
            writer_description, 
            illustrator_description, 
            editor_description, 
            user_description
        ],
        ),
    )
    ```

    In the previous code we have a `GroupChatManager` that is registered with the runtime. This manager is responsible for coordinating the interactions between different types of agents, such as writers, illustrators, editors, and users.

- **Agent Runtime**. The framework provides a runtime environment, enabling communication between agents, manages their identities and lifecycles, and enforce security and privacy boundaries. This means that you can run your agents in a secure and controlled environment, ensuring that they can interact safely and efficiently. There are two runtimes of interest:
  - **Stand-alone runtime**. This is a good choice for single-process applications where all agents are implemented in the same programming language and run in the same process. Here's an illustration of how it works:

Application stack

    *agents communicate via messages through the runtime, and the runtime manages the lifecycle of agents*

  - **Distributed agent runtime**, is suitable for multi-process applications where agents may be implemented in different programming languages and running on different machines. Here's an illustration of how it works:

## Semantic Kernel + Agent Framework

Semantic Kernel is an enterprise-ready AI Orchestration SDK. It consists of AI and memory connectors, along with an Agent Framework.

Let's first cover some core components:

- **AI Connectors**: This is an interface with external AI services and data sources for use in both Python and C#.

  ```python
  # Semantic Kernel Python
  from semantic_kernel.connectors.ai.open_ai import AzureChatCompletion
  from semantic_kernel.kernel import Kernel

  kernel = Kernel()
  kernel.add_service(
    AzureChatCompletion(
        deployment_name="your-deployment-name",
        api_key="your-api-key",
        endpoint="your-endpoint",
    )
  )
  ```  

    ```csharp
    // Semantic Kernel C#
    using Microsoft.SemanticKernel;

    // Create kernel
    var builder = Kernel.CreateBuilder();
    
    // Add a chat completion service:
    builder.Services.AddAzureOpenAIChatCompletion(
        "your-resource-name",
        "your-endpoint",
        "your-resource-key",
        "deployment-model");
    var kernel = builder.Build();
    ```

    Here you have a simple example of how you can create a kernel and add a chat completion service. Semantic Kernel creates a connection to an external AI service, in this case, Azure OpenAI Chat Completion.

- **Plugins**: These encapsulate functions that an application can use. There are both ready-made plugins and custom ones you can create. A related concept is "prompt functions." Instead of providing natural language cues for function invocation, you broadcast certain functions to the model. Based on the current chat context, the model may choose to call one of these functions to complete a request or query. Here's an example:

  ```python
  from semantic_kernel.connectors.ai.open_ai.services.azure_chat_completion import AzureChatCompletion


  async def main():
      from semantic_kernel.functions import KernelFunctionFromPrompt
      from semantic_kernel.kernel import Kernel

      kernel = Kernel()
      kernel.add_service(AzureChatCompletion())

      user_input = input("User Input:> ")

      kernel_function = KernelFunctionFromPrompt(
          function_name="SummarizeText",
          prompt="""
          Summarize the provided unstructured text in a sentence that is easy to understand.
          Text to summarize: {{$user_input}}
          """,
      )

      response = await kernel_function.invoke(kernel=kernel, user_input=user_input)
      print(f"Model Response: {response}")

      """
      Sample Console Output:

      User Input:> I like dogs
      Model Response: The text expresses a preference for dogs.
      """


  if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
  ```

    ```csharp
    var userInput = Console.ReadLine();

    // Define semantic function inline.
    string skPrompt = @"Summarize the provided unstructured text in a sentence that is easy to understand.
                        Text to summarize: {{$userInput}}";
    
    // create the function from the prompt
    KernelFunction summarizeFunc = kernel.CreateFunctionFromPrompt(
        promptTemplate: skPrompt,
        functionName: "SummarizeText"
    );

    //then import into the current kernel
    kernel.ImportPluginFromFunctions("SemanticFunctions", [summarizeFunc]);

    ```

    Here, you first have a template prompt `skPrompt` that leaves room for the user to input text, `$userInput`. Then you create the kernel function `SummarizeText` and then import it into the kernel with the plugin name `SemanticFunctions`. Note the name of the function that helps Semantic Kernel understand what the function does and when it should be called.

- **Native function**: There's also native functions that the framework can call directly to carry out the task. Here's an example of such a function retrieving the content from a file:

    ```csharp
    public class NativeFunctions {

        [SKFunction, Description("Retrieve content from local file")]
        public async Task<string> RetrieveLocalFile(string fileName, int maxSize = 5000)
        {
            string content = await File.ReadAllTextAsync(fileName);
            if (content.Length <= maxSize) return content;
            return content.Substring(0, maxSize);
        }
    }
    
    //Import native function
    string plugInName = "NativeFunction";
    string functionName = "RetrieveLocalFile";

   //To add the functions to a kernel use the following function
    kernel.ImportPluginFromType<NativeFunctions>();

    ```

- **Memory**:  Abstracts and simplifies context management for AI apps. The idea with memory is that this is something the LLM should know about. You can store this information in a vector store which ends up being an in-memory database or a vector database or similar. Here's an example of a very simplified scenario where *facts* are added to the memory:

    ```csharp
    var facts = new Dictionary<string,string>();
    facts.Add(
        "Azure Machine Learning; https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/",
        @"Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service for accelerating and
        managing the machine learning project lifecycle. Machine learning professionals,
        data scientists, and engineers can use it in their day-to-day workflows"
    );
    
    facts.Add(
        "Azure SQL Service; https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/",
        @"Azure SQL is a family of managed, secure, and intelligent products
        that use the SQL Server database engine in the Azure cloud."
    );
    
    string memoryCollectionName = "SummarizedAzureDocs";
    
    foreach (var fact in facts) {
        await memoryBuilder.SaveReferenceAsync(
            collection: memoryCollectionName,
            description: fact.Key.Split(";")[1].Trim(),
            text: fact.Value,
            externalId: fact.Key.Split(";")[2].Trim(),
            externalSourceName: "Azure Documentation"
        );
    }
    ```

    These facts are then stored in the memory collection `SummarizedAzureDocs`. This is a very simplified example, but you can see how you can store information in the memory for the LLM to use.
