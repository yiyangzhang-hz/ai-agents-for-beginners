[![Agentic Protocols](../../../translated_images/lesson-11-thumbnail.b6c742949cf1ce2aa0255968d287b31c99b51dfa9c9beaede7c3fbed90e8fcfb.en.png)](https://youtu.be/X-Dh9R3Opn8)

As AI agents become more prevalent, the need for protocols that ensure standardization, security, and foster open innovation grows. In this lesson, we’ll explore three protocols designed to address these needs: Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent-to-Agent (A2A), and Natural Language Web (NLWeb).

## Introduction

In this lesson, we’ll cover:

• How **MCP** enables AI agents to access external tools and data to complete user tasks.

• How **A2A** facilitates communication and collaboration between different AI agents.

• How **NLWeb** introduces natural language interfaces to websites, allowing AI agents to discover and interact with content.

## Learning Goals

• **Understand** the core purpose and benefits of MCP, A2A, and NLWeb in the context of AI agents.

• **Explain** how each protocol supports communication and interaction between LLMs, tools, and other agents.

• **Recognize** the unique roles each protocol plays in building complex agentic systems.

## Model Context Protocol

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that provides a consistent way for applications to offer context and tools to LLMs. It acts as a "universal adaptor" for connecting AI agents to various data sources and tools.

Let’s explore the components of MCP, its advantages over direct API usage, and an example of how AI agents might interact with an MCP server.

### MCP Core Components

MCP uses a **client-server architecture**, with the following key components:

• **Hosts**: LLM applications (e.g., a code editor like VSCode) that initiate connections to an MCP server.

• **Clients**: Components within the host application that maintain one-to-one connections with servers.

• **Servers**: Lightweight programs that provide specific capabilities.

MCP servers offer three core capabilities:

• **Tools**: Discrete actions or functions an AI agent can invoke to perform tasks. For example, a weather service might provide a "get weather" tool, or an e-commerce server might offer a "purchase product" tool. MCP servers list each tool’s name, description, and input/output schema.

• **Resources**: Read-only data items or documents that clients can retrieve on demand, such as file contents, database records, or log files. Resources can be text-based (e.g., code or JSON) or binary (e.g., images or PDFs).

• **Prompts**: Predefined templates that suggest prompts for more complex workflows.

### Benefits of MCP

MCP provides several advantages for AI agents:

• **Dynamic Tool Discovery**: Agents can dynamically access a list of available tools from a server, along with descriptions of their functions. Unlike traditional APIs, which require static coding for integrations, MCP allows for an "integrate once" approach, making systems more adaptable.

• **Interoperability Across LLMs**: MCP works with different LLMs, enabling flexibility to switch models for better performance.

• **Standardized Security**: MCP includes a unified authentication method, simplifying scalability when adding access to new MCP servers. This eliminates the need to manage multiple keys and authentication types for various APIs.

### MCP Example

Imagine a user wants to book a flight using an AI assistant powered by MCP.

1. **Connection**: The AI assistant (the MCP client) connects to an MCP server provided by an airline.

2. **Tool Discovery**: The client asks the airline’s MCP server, "What tools do you offer?" The server responds with tools like "search flights" and "book flights."

3. **Tool Invocation**: The user asks the AI assistant, "Find a flight from Portland to Honolulu." The assistant identifies the need to use the "search flights" tool and sends the relevant parameters (origin, destination) to the MCP server.

4. **Execution and Response**: The MCP server calls the airline’s internal booking API, retrieves flight information (e.g., JSON data), and sends it back to the assistant.

5. **Further Interaction**: The assistant presents flight options. Once the user selects a flight, the assistant invokes the "book flight" tool on the same MCP server to complete the booking.

## Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A)

While MCP connects LLMs to tools, the **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol** enables communication and collaboration between different AI agents. A2A allows agents across various organizations, environments, and tech stacks to work together on shared tasks.

We’ll explore the components and benefits of A2A, along with an example of its application in a travel scenario.

### A2A Core Components

A2A facilitates communication between agents, enabling them to collaborate on subtasks. Key components include:

#### Agent Card

Similar to an MCP server’s tool list, an Agent Card includes:

• The agent’s name.  
• A **description of its general tasks**.  
• A **list of specific skills** with descriptions to help other agents or users understand its capabilities.  
• The **current endpoint URL** of the agent.  
• The **version** and **capabilities** of the agent, such as streaming responses or push notifications.

#### Agent Executor

The Agent Executor is responsible for **passing user context to the remote agent**, enabling it to understand the task at hand. The remote agent uses its own LLM to parse requests and execute tasks using its internal tools.

#### Artifact

Once a remote agent completes a task, it produces an artifact. An artifact contains the **result of the agent’s work**, a **description of what was done**, and the **text context** sent through the protocol. The connection with the remote agent is closed until needed again.

#### Event Queue

This component manages **updates and message passing**, ensuring connections between agents remain open until tasks are completed, even for longer processes.

### Benefits of A2A

• **Enhanced Collaboration**: Agents from different vendors and platforms can interact, share context, and work together, enabling seamless automation across disconnected systems.

• **Model Selection Flexibility**: Each A2A agent can choose its own LLM for requests, allowing for optimized or fine-tuned models per agent.

• **Integrated Authentication**: A2A includes built-in authentication, ensuring secure interactions between agents.

### A2A Example

Let’s revisit the travel booking scenario, this time using A2A.

1. **User Request to Multi-Agent**: A user asks a "Travel Agent" A2A client/agent, "Plan a trip to Honolulu next week, including flights, a hotel, and a rental car."

2. **Orchestration by Travel Agent**: The Travel Agent uses its LLM to break down the request and determine which specialized agents to contact.

3. **Inter-Agent Communication**: The Travel Agent connects to downstream agents, such as an "Airline Agent," "Hotel Agent," and "Car Rental Agent," using the A2A protocol.

4. **Delegated Task Execution**: Each specialized agent handles its part of the request (e.g., finding flights, booking hotels, renting cars) using its own tools and LLMs.

5. **Consolidated Response**: The Travel Agent compiles the results and provides a comprehensive response to the user.

## Natural Language Web (NLWeb)

Websites have traditionally been the primary way users access information online. NLWeb introduces natural language interfaces to websites, enabling AI agents to interact with content seamlessly.

Let’s explore NLWeb’s components, benefits, and an example using our travel application.

### Components of NLWeb

- **NLWeb Application (Core Service Code)**: The system that processes natural language queries and connects platform components to generate responses.

- **NLWeb Protocol**: A basic set of rules for natural language interaction with websites, returning responses in JSON format (often using Schema.org). It serves as a foundation for the “AI Web,” similar to how HTML enabled document sharing online.

- **MCP Server (Model Context Protocol Endpoint)**: Each NLWeb setup functions as an MCP server, sharing tools and data with other AI systems. This allows websites to integrate into the broader “agent ecosystem.”

- **Embedding Models**: These models convert website content into numerical representations (embeddings) for comparison and search. Users can select their preferred embedding model.

- **Vector Database (Retrieval Mechanism)**: Stores embeddings of website content. When a query is made, NLWeb searches the database for relevant information and ranks results by similarity.

### NLWeb by Example

![NLWeb](../../../translated_images/nlweb-diagram.c1e2390b310e5fe4b245b86690ac6c49c26e355da5ab124128c8675d58cc9b07.en.png)

Consider a travel booking website powered by NLWeb.

1. **Data Ingestion**: The website’s product catalogs (e.g., flight listings, hotel descriptions) are formatted using Schema.org or RSS feeds. NLWeb ingests this data, creates embeddings, and stores them in a vector database.

2. **Natural Language Query (Human)**: A user types into a chat interface: "Find a family-friendly hotel in Honolulu with a pool for next week."

3. **NLWeb Processing**: NLWeb interprets the query using an LLM and searches its vector database for relevant listings.

4. **Accurate Results**: The LLM refines the search results, identifies the best matches, and formats a natural language response based on the website’s catalog.

5. **AI Agent Interaction**: External AI agents can connect to the website’s NLWeb instance via MCP, querying the site directly for structured responses.
